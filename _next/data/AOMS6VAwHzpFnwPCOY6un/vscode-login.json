So I decided to write this article to help others.\n\n### Why is it happening?\n\nIn my specific case it was caused by the fact that the **Vscode app was running from the Downloads folder** and so it didn't\nhave the required permissions to write to cache the login token. So every time I launched the app, it was asking me to\nlogin again.\n    \n\n### How to fix it?\n\nThe fix is very simple, just **move the Vscode app to the Applications folder** and launch it from there. This will give it\nthe required permissions to write to cache the login token and after one last login, you won't be prompted again.\n\nif you wish to do so via terminal, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nmv ~/Downloads/Visual\\ Studio\\ Code.app /Applications\n```\n\nif you get the popup saying that macos prevented terminal from modifying the Applications folder, you can run the previous\ncommand with `sudo`:\n\n```bash\nsudo mv ~/Downloads/Visual\\ Studio\\ Code.app /Applications\n```\nyou will be prompted to enter your password and then the command will run successfully.\n\n","tags":["Vscode","Github","Copilot","fix"],"banner":"/images/vscode-login/banner.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
